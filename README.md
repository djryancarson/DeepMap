# DeepMap Mobile App

The Deep Map mobile app project is a cross-platform mobile application built in React Native. As such, it is a fully functional iOS and Android application. It is based on the existing [Deepmap Website](https://github.com/djryancarson/Deep-Map) located on the Trubox website.

# Building the project and running the app

In order to run the DeepMap project, you first have to setup React Native on your local machine. The instructions on how to do so are located on the [React Native Website](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). For this project, we built the project using the React Native CLI Quickstart instructions, so the project has not been tested with the Expo environment.

### Android

##### Running the Debug Version

1. Open a command line and navigate to the project folder 
2. run `npm i`
3. `adb uninstall com.deepmap` (only necessary if a previous version is already installed)
4. `npx react-native run-android`

Note: this will often fail when trying to build the debug app. In our experience, you sometimes have to run `npx react-native run-android` up to 5 times for it to successfully build. An alternative to this would be to simply run the android folder within Android Studio.

##### Building the Release Version

1. Move the **gradle.properties** file with the keystore info to `DeepMap\android`
2. Move the **my-upload-key.keystore** to `DeepMap\android\app`
3. Open a command line and navigate to the android folder of the project (`DeepMap\android`)
4. Run `gradlew bundleRelease`
   * Note: the [Official Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android) advises to use `./gradlew bundleRelease`. In our experience, this does not work on a Windows Environment
5. Navigate back to `DeepMap` and run `npx react-native run-android --variant=release`
6. The release apk will be located at `DeepMap\android\app\build\outputs\apk\release`


### iOS build

You have have some issues using the command npx react-native run-ios

If you get errors when building 
 1. Make sure to have Cocoapods installed
 2. Navigate to the IOS Folder in your Terminal
 3. Use the command `pod install`
 4. Try building the app again

# Relevant Project Files & Folders

Many of the files in the project directory are generated by React Native, but there are some important files that must be worked on in order to modify the project.

### App.js

This file is the main file that loads everything in the project upon opening. It is similar to the Driver class or Index file of a typical program or webpage. This file includes all of the import statements relevant to the project, the HomeScreen class including all the UI elements that appear when the app loads for the first time, the integration for the Firebase database and the Style Sheet that includes all the styling necessary for the UI elements.

### VirtualCommunitiesList.js

This is the view for the Virtual Communities that is imported in the **App.js** file. It populates a list of virtual communities on the second tab of the app.

### package.json & node_modules

The **package.json** file includes a list of the necessary dependencies needed for the React Native project. When the command `npm i` is run, it looks to this file to create everything necessary in the **node_modules** folder.

### ios & android

The **ios** and **android** folders hold the project files for the iOS and Android projects respectively. They were automatically generated when the React Native project was created and change content based on and change as the React Native project is edited and rebuilt. These folders can be directly imported into the xCode and Android Studio IDEs, allowing for easy testing if already familiar with these IDEs or further implementation specific to either platform.
