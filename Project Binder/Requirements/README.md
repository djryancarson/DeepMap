# Initial Requirements

* Develop a mobile app with the same features as the [Deep Map Website](https://access.trubox.ca/)
  * Integrated map of locations
  * Filter for different resources to appear on the map

### Week 3

* Possibility of Community Feature system, using Database and User Authentication & Management features
  * Added after the base prototype of the app looks polished and functional to the clientâ€™s expectations

* Distributing through both iOS and Android
  * Android is simple and easy to distribute, Ryan has gone through the process of publishing on the Google Play Store before
  * iOS has an overhead cost of $99 USD per year, client will follow up with her contacts at TRU about the costs and process of distributing the app through TRU's channels

* Develop for Android and iOS using React Native
  * Developing using a cross-platform tool would be a great learning experience 
  * Open to alternatives depending on how the development of the first iteration goes
