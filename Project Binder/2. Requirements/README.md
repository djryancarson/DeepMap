# Requirements

For this project, the requirements were rather simple from a client deliverable perspective. She simply wanted an app to do all of the functionality available currently on the DeepMap Website. While the deliverables seemed easy, the requirement to have the app present on both Android and iOS presented some unique challenges in terms of technical requirements. In addition, we also had to consider how our client would manage the content on the app itself.

# Initial Requirements

* Develop a mobile app with the same features as the [Deep Map Website](https://access.trubox.ca/)
  * Integrated map of locations
  * Filter for different resources to appear on the map

### Week 3

* Possibility of Community Feature system, using Database and User Authentication & Management features
  * Added after the base prototype of the app looks polished and functional to the clientâ€™s expectations
  * Considered as a "nice to have" feature, but not a necessary requirement
* Distributing through both iOS and Android
  * Android is simple and easy to distribute, Ryan has gone through the process of publishing on the Google Play Store before
  * iOS has an overhead cost of $99 USD per year, client will follow up with her contacts at TRU about the costs and process of distributing the app through TRU's channels

* Develop for Android and iOS using React Native
  * Developing using a cross-platform tool would be a great learning experience 
  * Open to alternatives depending on how the development of the first iteration goes

### Week 4

* App needs to scale for tablets and larger phones
* Need to make sure the app will run on iOS early in development

### Week 5

* Cloud-based database required for client to add, edit and manage the points on the map
  * Decided to try Google Firebase, as we have some experience with it already and integrates nicely with Mobile and Web platforms
* App should have scrolling tabs, rather than having buttons on the bottom of the screen to go to separate pages
* App should use a native map within the app, rather than using a WebView displaying content already on the DeepMap Site

### Week 6

* Can distribute app on app stores with our own accounts, doesn't have to go through official TRU channels
* App should have a tab for "Virtual Communities", online resources without a physical location (ie. a Facebook group)
* We should be providing an easy-to-use webpage hosted on a website that the client can manage the data from the database

### Week 10

* Map markers should have a pop-out page, where a marker can be tapped on again to show a page that consists of all relevant information for that marker
